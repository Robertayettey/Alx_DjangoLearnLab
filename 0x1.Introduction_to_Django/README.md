# LibraryProject

This is a basic Django project created as part of learning Django. It contains the default structure that comes with starting a new project using `django-admin startproject`.

## Steps to run the project:
1. Navigate to the `LibraryProject` directory.
2. Run `python manage.py runserver`.
3. Open a browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see the Django welcome page.
